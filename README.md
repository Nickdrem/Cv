##PROJECT ANALYSIS

### Target user profile
The CV was developed with a specific target user profile in mind. This CV is aiming at professionals in the industry of video games, especially, those who are looking for a programmer or/and a level designer. In the document, the user can find all the information that is usually found in a CV. We can find the contact information, the technical skills, the work experience and the educational path, along with the First Certification (B2), the bachelor degree and the university degree.

### Information architecture
First, we can see the contact information. On the right side of the CV, we can see a picture, a Gmail, and a phone number. There’s also the town I'm residing in at the moment. Below the contact information, we can find the technical skills. There’s a list of programs like games engines, programming languages, and animation programs. Finishing with the right side, we have the languages that I'm able to work with, and my LinkedIn site. The first thing we can see on the left side, is my name and the position I aspire to be, and below that, the work experience. It also features the projects that I was involved in as a programmer and level design. At the bottom of the document, there’s my educational path. It shows the institutions where I have been formed.

This structure is chosen to provide a clear and organized presentation of relevant information to potential companies who want to hire me. 

### Visual design
There’s not much to say about the visual design. It's really simple and minimalistic, and its principal function is to emphasize the content written in it. I like to highlight the companies that I worked with, changing the color, and making them stand out.
